This is an attempt at a (relatively) high performance tensor library, utilizing
expression templates (currently to-be-added) and variadic templating from the
C++11 standard. The goal is to produce a multi-dimensional array (vector)
interface that is as syntactically simple to use as possible without sacrificing
performance.

To potential users: While I will be striving to match the performance of the
Boost library's multi_array, I would strongly suggest using Boost over this. If
the use of the Boost library is permissible in your case, it will afford you a
greater amount of performance and flexibility than is currently possible with
anything in this library. As well, the Boost library has been thoroughly tested
and optimized for performance, while this is still in the implementation phase.

Just pushed a major overhaul I've been working on. Progress stalled due to a new
job at U.Chicago, so I figured I'd throw this up for now. Needs to be tested and
needs expression templating for basic tensor operations.
